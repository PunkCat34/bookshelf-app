<h2>A simple book registry application</h2>

I'm planning to take several online courses soon. Before i start, i just needed to show at least what i currently know. That's why i developed this project.

This is a simple book management project that allows users to add some books into their virtual shelves.

<h3>There is 3 different user tiers: Users, Admins and AppMaster</h3>

AppMaster manages all the users on database.

Admins search book from "Google Books" by using keywords. (Google Books API is used)

Admins also perform another stuff like saving, removing etc...

And users, can save some book from admin shelves.

<h3>Here is some displays:</h3>
